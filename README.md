# Dotfiles

Contain all dotfiles and submodules required for my Vim setup, along with some ZSH configuration,
tmux and what not.

**Note:** Works out of the box on `macOS`, but should be fairly easy to port to any linux distro,
with the following changes:
* `tmux-spotify` doesn't work on linux. It can be replaced though. 
* Change the apple icon to tux :)
    

## Requirements

* `neovim >= 0.6.0`
* `tmux` 
* `zsh`


## Thanks

Almost all is based on amazing plugins and themes with no/small modifications. For easy upgrades in
the future, plugins are referenced as submodules. I've made modifications to the following:

* The TMUX theme I am using the amazing is [maglev](https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev) by [caigondim](https://github.com/caiogondim) with only small modifications.
